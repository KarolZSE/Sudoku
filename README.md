# Sudoku
Simple game of sudoku rules are simple:
the objective is to fill a 9 × 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3 × 3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid - via Wikipedia.org (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku)

# You can customize
- The board size
- The number of empty squares

While picking the number of squares missing here is a table of difficulty:

| Sudoku Size     | Easy (Low diff)  | Medium diff     | Hard diff          |
| --------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| **9×9 board**   | ~30–40 missing   | ~41–50 missing   | ~51–60+ missing   |
| **16×16 board** | ~60–80 missing   | ~81–100 missing  | ~101–120+ missing |
| **25×25 board** | ~120–160 missing | ~161–200 missing | ~201–250+ missing |

# Important for mobile users!
In my experience the 9x9 board loads perfectly hovewer a 16x16 board overflows. Soo for bigger boards please switch to a pc.
